Instant Messaging App

This is a simple instant messaging application implemented in Java, consisting of a server (server.java) and a client (client.java). The server and client communicate over sockets to enable real-time messaging between multiple clients.

Features
Server-Client Communication: The server and client communicate over sockets, allowing messages to be sent and received in real-time.
Simple User Interface: Although not included in the code provided, the application can be extended with a graphical or command-line user interface (UI) for a more user-friendly experience.
Error Handling: The code includes basic error handling for handling exceptions such as unknown hosts and I/O errors.
Usage


Server (server.java)
Compile the server.java file.

javac server.java
Run the server.


java server
The server will start and wait for clients to connect.

Client (client.java)
Compile the client.java file.

javac client.java
Run the client.


java client
Enter messages in the client's console and press Enter to send them to the server. The client will receive responses from the server and display them in the console.
